Thank you for taking the Data Science Challenge!

The goal of this challenge is to test your knowledge of Data Science fundamentals through a series of questions.

Guidelines

This challenge has 5 questions to complete
You must do your work utilizing a single Jupyter Notebook 
Add comments as much as possible and explain what you are doing and why. It is very important that everything is explained in a clear and thorough manner. 
Apply the appropriate models where applicable
Assume your audience is non technical business users

Challenge Description

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
In this challenge, we ask you to complete a series of analysis on the datasets given.
The datasets and paths are:

../datasets/train.csv
../datasets/test.csv
../datasets/gender_submission.csv
 
1.  Getting Started
Give your notebook a title with your full name included
Import any libraries you may need

2. Understanding and visualizing the data
How many people survived? 
Which gender was more likely to have survived?
What was the average fare price?

3. Deeper analysis of the data
Were there a class(es) of passengers who were more likely to have survived? 

4. Let's do some Machine Learning!
Make a prediction of which passengers will survive. The result set should be two columns, PassengerId and Survived
What is the accuracy of your test?

5. How would you handle the missing data? 

Download your notebook (.ipynb) and submit.
